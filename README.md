## Introduction

Wrestle Match is a memory game involving the classic card matching mechanic. To win a game of Wrestle Match, 
users are required to match pairs of cards with backs facing (to hide the image on the front face) until all cards on the game
board have been revealed. This is a test of a user's short term memory, speed and accuracy as the clock is ticking and the 
more matching attempts or moves that are made, the lower star rating the user receives upon completion of their current game.
This game like any typical memory matching game, for it's simple gameplay mechanics, can be enjoyed in short bursts by just 
about anybody, unless you just don't like anything to do with the subject of wrestling then this might not be for you. The 
real challenge is trying to get a 5-star rating whilst completing a game in the shortest possible time. And although this is 
a singleplayer game at it's core, users in the local vacinity to each other can take turns playing the game on a single 
device, trying to beat eachothers star ratings and completion times. This particular game will be quite unique, in that the 
images on the faces of cards can be a completely different set from one game to the next and this adds much more colour and 
variety to the game board aswell as extra replayability as the user doesn't have to see the same small setof imagery each 
game they play.

## UX (User Experience)

- Does this fit my user's needs? 
- Does the user like my website?
- Does the user like being at my website?
- Is this a website a user might want to return to in the future?

These are all questions I asked myself throughout the UX design process.

### User Goals and Expectations

#### Goals for the main users: The Players, and their expectations

- In short bursts, a fun card matching game with flip animation thats very easy for anybody to play with minimal to no 
complications during the process.
- No instructions are really required for anyone to enjoy this game but are provided in any case, without being intrusive.
- An extra appeal to fans of wrestling from the 1980s to the present day.
- Users can enjoy a tried and tested colour palette throughout the main layout of the website thats both pleasant and easy 
on the eyes. Imagery used in the game board during play provides temporary bursts of colour and variety.

User expectations:

- Quickly develop a clear understanding of the website navigation and game mechanics including controls and scoring system.
- The homepage provides quick access to the game via a start button.

#### Goals as the developer

- Develop and deploy a fully intuitive, visually attractive gaming experience that engages with anyone in some way.
- Appeal and gain attention from wrestling fans of old and the current wrestling scene no matter their age.
- Expand my portfolio of coding projects with a website, design and development process I'm confident in and proud of, to 
show to prospective employers.

Developer expectations:

- How does this fit my user's needs? - The controls,mechanics and interactive elements should be obvious to the user.
- Why the user should like my website - Is it visually appealling? There is a continous theme and the colour scheme 
contrasts and compliments well with the overall design.
- Why the user would like spending time at my website? - The game is fun enough to play in short bursts and the variety in 
game modes, and the large array of imagery helps to increase replayability. The user can play alone or compete against friends 
and family.
- Is this a website a user might want to return to in the future? - It ticks all the above boxes and with high reliability
in the game being accessible and playable on any device with an up to date browser, these reasons should be able entice some 
users to return in the future.
